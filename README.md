# Apple-Image-Detection
As a Applied Business Analytics project at Praxis Business School, I built a model to classify apples into good and bad apples using YOLOv5 model.
Some the use cases where the model can be deployed effectively are large online grocery stores and can be used by farmers to segregate rotten fruits and vegetables.
